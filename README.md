# Computer-Science-II
Repository dedicated to all of the projects I built in my Computer Science II class. Similar to my CS - 1 class except it's got larger and more dense projects that aren't just for practicing some fundamental programming concepts. Covers objects, classes, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, linked lists, verification, and unit testing.
